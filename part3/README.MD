## Getting Started: PROJECT PART 3
NOTE: the dataset and query images are NOT provided in the zip file

### to compile and run:
```bash
go run similaritySearch.go <filepath to query image .jpg> <filepath to dataset directory>
```

for example:
since I put my query images folder and dataset folder in part1 of this project, I would put the filepath in the command-line arguments
```bash
go run similaritySearch.go ../part1/queryImages/q01.jpg ../part1/imageDataset2_15_20
```
